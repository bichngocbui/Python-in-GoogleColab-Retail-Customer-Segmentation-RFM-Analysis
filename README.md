# Python-RFM-Analysis-and-Customer-Segmentation-Visualization
## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis system for SuperStore's global retail operations. The analysis aims to support the Marketing team's customer segmentation efforts for their year-end marketing campaigns, transitioning from manual Excel-based analysis to an automated Python solution due to increased data volume.
## Business Context
SuperStore, a global retail company, needs to segment their large customer base effectively for targeted Christmas and New Year marketing campaigns. The Marketing department requires a data-driven approach to:
- Identify and reward loyal customers
- Discover potential high-value customers
- Develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments
## Key Analysis Areas
### RFM Score Calculation
- Recency (R): Based on InvoiceDate, Days between last purchase and reference date
- Frequency (F): Derived from unique InvoiceNo count per CustomerID
- Monetary (M): Calculated from Quantity Ã— UnitPrice
### Customer Segmentation
Implementation of quintile-based scoring system:
- Score range: 1-5 for each RFM component
- Statistical quintile method for fair distribution
- Combined RFM segmentation based on score patterns
### Visualization & Analysis
- Distribution of Recency, Frequency, Monetary 
- Customer segment distribution visualization of Customer Count, Customer Revenue
## Bussiness value
### Immediate Benefits
#### Marketing Efficiency
- Targeted campaigns based on customer segments
- Reduced marketing costs through precise targeting
- Higher conversion rates from personalized approaches
#### Customer Insights
- Clear identification of VIP customers
- Early detection of churning customers
- Recognition of potential high-value customers
#### Revenue Optimization
- Focused retention strategies for valuable segments
- Customized promotions for each customer group
- Better resource allocation for marketing campaigns
### Long-term Impact
- Improved customer lifetime value
- Enhanced customer loyalty
- Data-driven decision making for future campaigns
## Dataset Description
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. Reference date for Recency calculation: December 31, 2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. The analysis uses the following fields:

## Technical Implementation
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
## Exploring the Dataset
### Cleaning Data 
```python
# Display general information about the dataframe, including non-null counts and data types
ecommerce_retail.info()
# Provide descriptive statistics for numeric columns such as Quantity and UnitPrice
ecommerce_retail.describe()
# Remove rows with missing values in the CustomerID column to ensure valid customer information
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])
# Filter rows where Quantity is greater than 0 and drop any rows with missing values in Quantity
# This ensures only transactions with a positive quantity are included
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] > 0].dropna(subset=['Quantity'])
# Filter rows where UnitPrice is greater than 0 and drop any rows with missing values in UnitPrice
# This keeps only valid transactions with positive prices, important for revenue and profit calculations
ecommerce_retail = ecommerce_retail[ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice'] > 0].dropna(subset=['UnitPrice'])
# Display the cleaned dataframe
ecommerce_retail
```

### RFM Calculation and Segmentation
```python
# Set a reference date for calculating recency (the latest date in the dataset)
reference_date = pd.to_datetime('2011-12-31')
# Calculate the total amount for each transaction by multiplying Quantity and UnitPrice
ecommerce_retail['TotalAmount'] = ecommerce_retail['Quantity'] * ecommerce_retail['UnitPrice']
# Create an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) dataframe by grouping data by CustomerID
rfm = ecommerce_retail.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
    # Recency: calculate the number of days since the customer's last purchase by finding the max InvoiceDate for each customer
    'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (reference_date - x.max()).days,
    # Frequency: count the unique invoices (number of purchases) for each customer
    'InvoiceNo': 'nunique',
    # Monetary: sum the total amount spent by each customer
    'TotalAmount': 'sum'
}).reset_index().rename(columns={
    'InvoiceDate': 'Recency',   # Rename InvoiceDate column to Recency
    'InvoiceNo': 'Frequency',   # Rename InvoiceNo column to Frequency
    'TotalAmount': 'Monetary'   # Rename TotalAmount column to Monetary

In conclusion, the business is performing well in retaining the Champions group â€“ the most important customer segment. However, there is a need to improve strategies for other segments to optimize revenue. Key segments to focus on include:
- Champions (19.13% of customers, 62.65% of revenue): This is the most loyal and highest value customer group.
- Loyal (9.98% of customers, 11.70% of revenue): This group also holds high value and has the potential to become Champions with proper care.
- At Risk (9.77% of customers, 8.45% of revenue): This group is at risk of leaving the business but still contributes significantly to revenue.
- Lost Customers (11.32% of customers, 1.10% of revenue): Although contributing little to revenue, this group represents a large percentage of total customers.
## Conclusion
In summary, effective customer segmentation is essential for optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer retention. By identifying and understanding the distinct characteristics of each segment, particularly the Champions, Loyal, At Risk, and Lost Customers, the business can tailor its approach to maximize engagement and revenue. Implementing targeted strategies for these key segments will not only strengthen customer loyalty but also drive sustainable growth in the long term.
